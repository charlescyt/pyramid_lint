# Getting Started

## Installation

Run the following command to add `custom_lint` and `pyramid_lint` to your project's dev dependencies:

```sh
dart pub add --dev custom_lint pyramid_lint
```

Then enable `custom_lint` in your `analysis_options.yaml` file. You can also exclude generated files from analysis.

```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint

  exclude:
    - "**.freezed.dart"
    - "**.g.dart"
    - "**.gr.dart"
```

## Configuration

### Enable Lints

By default, all lints are disabled. To enable a specific lint, add the following to your `analysis_options.yaml` file:

```yaml
custom_lint:
  rules:
    - specific_lint_rule # enable specific_lint_rule
```

### Change Severity

You can change the severity of a particular lint. The available severities are `info`, `warning`, and `error`. To change the severity of a lint, add the following to your `analysis_options.yaml` file:

```yaml
custom_lint:
  rules:
    - specific_lint_rule:
      severity: warning
```

### Configure Lints

Some lints are configurable. To configure a lint, follow the example below:

```yaml
custom_lint:
  rules:
    - configurable_lint_rule:
      option1: value1
      option2: value2
```
