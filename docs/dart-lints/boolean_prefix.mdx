class Point {
  final double x;
  final double y;

  const Point(this.x, this.y);

  bool get origin => x == 0 && y == 0;

  bool samePoint(Point other) => x == other.x && y == other.y;
}
```

```dart title="Good"
class Point {
  final double x;
  final double y;

  const Point(this.x, this.y);

  bool get isOrigin => x == 0 && y == 0;

  bool isSamePoint(Point other) => x == other.x && y == other.y;
}
```

## Usage

To enable the `boolean_prefix` rule, add `boolean_prefix` under custom_lint > rules in your `analysis_options.yaml` file:

```yaml
custom_lint:
  rules:
    - boolean_prefix
```

To configure the list of valid prefixes, add a list of strings to the `valid_prefixes` option:

```yaml
custom_lint:
  rules:
    - boolean_prefix:
        valid_prefixes: ['is', 'has']
```
