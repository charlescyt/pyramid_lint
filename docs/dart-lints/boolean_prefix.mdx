Bad

```dart
class Point {
  final double x;
  final double y;

  const Point(this.x, this.y);

  bool get origin => x == 0 && y == 0;

  bool samePoint(Point other) => x == other.x && y == other.y;
}
```

Good

```dart
class Point {
  final double x;
  final double y;

  const Point(this.x, this.y);

  bool get isOrigin => x == 0 && y == 0;

  bool isSamePoint(Point other) => x == other.x && y == other.y;
}
```
